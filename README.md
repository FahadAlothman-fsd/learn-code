# Learning Languages

<hr>

This repo will contain all the languages i want to learn, which are:
- gleam
- julia
- elixir
- rust
- go
- scala

I will add whenever i find an interesting language.
<hr>

## How will I learn?

I will use the following two resources as the foundation for learning:
- [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/)
- building a webserver


### advent of code 

When i start with a language, I will do three days of a previous year (or until i get bored :3).
For the current year, I will try solving it day by day.

### Building a webserver

When i feel confident enough in my ability with a certain language (maybe after lets say 10 days with aoc), i will start building a webserver.

this webserver will help me learn the following:
- CRUD operations
- HTTP verbs
- authentication
- templating (htmx + maybe tailwind)
- deployement

with most languages, their isn't core support for http. So i will shop around for libraries/frameworks and pick the most popular one (one with most community support) and go with it.

<hr>

## When will i stop writing in a particular language

I will most likely stop when i build and deployed a webserver in that language.
